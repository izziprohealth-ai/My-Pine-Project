IBO Signal Improvement Notes (ZZentryexitscoreOri.pine)
=======================================================

Objective
---------
Improve IBO signal precision/reliability in ZZentryexitscoreOri.pine by borrowing the proven Buy 1 / Buy 2 confirmation style from IBOtrade.pine.

What was improved
-----------------
1) Added a dedicated "IBO Trade Precision Layer" in ZZentryexitscoreOri.pine.
   - Reused the same core logic style from IBOtrade:
     * Donchian breakout confirmation (close > previous Donchian upper)
     * Momentum confirmation using J > D (KDJ-style smoothing)
     * Trend alignment with EMA5 >= EMA10 and close >= EMA21
     * Bollinger breakout confirmation (close >= upper band)
     * Volume filters split into normal and strong volume

2) Added explicit precision signal states:
   - iboBuy1: Standard quality breakout confirmation
   - iboBuy2: Strong breakout confirmation (higher volume requirement)

3) Tightened current IBO entry filter:
   - Existing iboEntry now requires iboBuy1 in addition to your prior IBO conditions.
   - This reduces weak/early breakouts and helps avoid low-quality trigger bars.

4) Added optional labels to visualize quality:
   - buy 1 label for confirmed precision entry bars
   - buy 2 label for stronger conviction bars
   - Controlled via input: "Show IBO Buy 1 / Buy 2 labels"

New tunable inputs
------------------
- IBO Donchian Length
- IBO Bollinger Length
- IBO Bollinger Multiplier
- IBO Strong Volume Multiplier
- Show IBO Buy 1 / Buy 2 labels

Expected impact
---------------
- Better signal quality by requiring confluence (structure + momentum + trend + volatility + volume).
- More reliable entries in trending markets.
- Clear separation between normal and strong IBO setups.

Practical usage tip
-------------------
- For stricter filtering (fewer but cleaner signals):
  increase "IBO Strong Volume Multiplier" and/or increase Bollinger multiplier.
- For slightly earlier entries (more frequent signals):
  reduce Bollinger multiplier modestly.
